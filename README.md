## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get your Folder Organizer up and running.

### Prerequisites

You need **Python 3.x** installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation & Running

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepoName.git](https://github.com/yogawilanda/FolderOrganizer.exe.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate into the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd YourRepoName # Replace YourRepoName with the name of your repository folder
    ```
3.  **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    python your_script_name.py # Replace 'your_script_name.py' with the actual name of your main Python file (e.g., folder_organizer.py)
    ```

### Customizing the Target Folder

By default, the script is set to organize `C:/Users/{username}/Downloads`. You can easily change this to any folder you wish by editing the `target_folder` variable directly in the Python script:

```python
# main execution flow of the program
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # ...
    target_folder = "C:/Users/{username}/Downloads" # <--- Change this path!
    # ...
